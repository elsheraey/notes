# redwoodjs

## Notes

- I've done a couple of the [official RedwoodJS tutorials](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/tutorial/foreword).

- I like it as a tool to bring up things fast, due to the use of boilerplate generators, while forcing you to follow best practices which makes it cool for a quick CRUD project.

So far, I might say I've two comments on it though:

- It's very opinionated and this strips the developer, to an extent, from the freedom of making some decisions and I don't think that everyone would be happy with that beyond small projects.

- Mistaking faster development for less code cause you're still creating a monster, you're doing it faster but it's still a monster as shown in the preview showcasing a little bit of the official tutorial to create a simple blog :")
